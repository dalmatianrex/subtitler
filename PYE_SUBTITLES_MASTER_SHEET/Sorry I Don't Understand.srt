0:0:00,000 --> 0:0:08,000
Sorry I don't understand

0:0:09,000 --> 0:0:13,000
When you meet new people they don’t know that you don’t speak English.

3
0:0:14,000 --> 0:0:17,000
If I go to a new country the first thing I learn to say is,

4
0:0:18,000 --> 0:0:23,000
‘sorry, I don’t understand’. That way they know I’m not being rude if I don’t answer them.

5
0:0:34,000 --> 0:0:35,000
Sorry, I don’t understand.

7
0:0:35,000 --> 0:0:38,000
Can you speak more slowly please? Okay. Thanks.

8
0:0:39,000 --> 0:0:40,000
Let’s practice.

9
0:0:41,000 --> 0:0:57,000
Sorry, I don’t understand.

10
0:0:59,000 --> 0:1:21,000
Can you speak more slowly please?

11
0:1:21,000 --> 0:1:22,000
Very good!
