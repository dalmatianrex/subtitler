0:0:00,000 --> 0:0:08,000
Talking about the weather

2
0:0:08,000 --> 0:0:13,000
If you meet somebody for the first time you might talk about personal things straight away,

3
0:0:13,000 --> 0:0:18,000
but here in the UK you don’t do that – you talk about non-personal things.

4
0:0:18,000 --> 0:0:21,000
So this might be when you’re passing your neighbour in the street,

5
0:0:21,000 --> 0:0:25,000
or if you’re at the queue in the bus stop or in the supermarket.

6
0:0:25,000 --> 0:0:28,000
A really popular topic is the weather.

7
0:0:28,000 --> 0:0:32,000
Once you’ve spoken to someone casually maybe 2 or 3 times,

8
0:0:32,000 --> 0:0:36,000
or if you’re meeting someone more ‘officially’

9
0:0:36,000 --> 0:0:42,000
(like your child’s new teacher or a new neighbour or somebody that your friend is introducing you to)

10
0:0:42,000 --> 0:0:45,000
then you can talk about more personal things,

11
0:0:45,000 --> 0:0:50,000
maybe how your children are getting on at school, or whether you like the area that you’re in.

12
0:0:50,000 --> 0:0:54,000
So we’re going to learn language to talk about the weather,

13
0:0:54,000 --> 0:1:00,000
because you can use that with everyone, all the time. Let’s listen to people talking about the weather:

14
0:1:00,000 --> 0:1:05,000
Nice today, isn’t it? Yes, lovely. Bit cold today isn’t it? Yeah, freezing.

15
0:1:05,000 --> 0:1:10,000
Now let’s practice how to say this and make the right sounds:

16
0:1:10,000 --> 0:1:16,000
Nice today, isn't it? - Yes.

17
0:1:16,000 --> 0:1:20,000
Bit cold today, isn't it? - Yes.

18
0:1:20,000 --> 0:1:23,000
Nice today, isn't it? - Yes.

19
0:1:23,000 --> 0:1:26,000
Bit cold today, isn't it? - Yes.

20
0:1:28,000 --> 0:1:37,000
So let’s try this bit: ‘isn’t it?’ Nice today. Very good!
