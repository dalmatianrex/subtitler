Talking About  What You Want And Need

2
0:0:8,000 --> 0:0:13,000
In English there are several ways to ask about what you want or need,

3
0:0:14,000 --> 0:0:16,000
so we’re going to let you listen to some now 

4
0:0:16,000 --> 0:0:19,000
so that you can understand what people are saying when they speak to you.

5
0:0:19,000 --> 0:0:26,000
Then at the end I’ll help you practice a few simple ones you can use when you want to ask for something.

6
0:0:27,000 --> 0:0:36,000
Have you got a pen please? Sure, here you are. Thanks.

7
0:0:37,000 --> 0:0:46,000
Have you got the time please? Yes, it’s 2.40.

8
0:0:47,000 --> 0:0:52,000
Do you need a break now? Yes, I’m tired.

9
0:0:53,000 --> 0:1:00,000
Can you pass me that pen please? Yeah, there you go.

10
0:1:01,000 --> 0:1:07,000
Shall we swap these over? Yeah, good idea.

11
0:1:08,000 --> 0:1:16,000
Which one? This one or that one? This one please. Here you go.

12
0:1:18,000 --> 0:1:22,000
Which one, this one or that one? Both, please. Here you go

13
0:1:23,000 --> 0:1:33,000
I don’t know what I’m doing, can you help me? OK.

14
0:1:34,000 --> 0:1:38,000
Let’s practise asking for what you want and need in a really simple, easy way. 

15
0:1:40,000 --> 0:2:06,000
Can I have a pen please? Can you help me please?

16
0:2:07,000 --> 0:2:18,000
and this is the same here, can you help me please?

17
0:2:18,000 --> 0:2:20,000
That's good.
