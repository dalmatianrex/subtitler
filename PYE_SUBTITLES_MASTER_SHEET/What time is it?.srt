1
0:0:00,000 --> 0:0:08,000
What time is it?

2
0:0:09,000 --> 0:0:12,000
There are two ways to tell the time,

3
0:0:13,000 --> 0:0:16,000
The digital clock and the traditional clock.

4
0:0:17,000 --> 0:0:24,000
The digital clock is much easier, so for example: 10:25

5
0:0:25,000 --> 0:0:34,000
The bad news is that in the UK lots of people use this traditional clock to tell the time.

6
0:0:36,000 --> 0:0:43,000
This circle is one hour, and there are 60 minutes in an hour.

7
0:0:44,000 --> 0:0:48,000
On zero minutes, we say '2 o'clock'

8
0:0:49,000 --> 0:0:58,000
So, we look at 'half', 2 halves, we talk about half an hour - that's 30 minutes.

9
0:0:59,000 --> 0:1:08,000
So… half past 2.

10
0:1:09,000 --> 0:1:15,000
Or if we move this one, maybe half past 4.

11
0:1:12,000 --> 0:1:22,000
Fifteen minutes is a quarter of an hour.

12
0:1:24,000 --> 0:1:28,000
This is a quarter.

13
0:1:29,000 --> 0:1:33,000
So we say, 'quarter past 4'.

14
0:1:34,000 --> 0:1:41,000
It means 'quarter of an hour past 4', but that's very long, so we say 'quarter past' for short.

15
0:1:42,000 --> 0:1:50,000
So this whole section is talking about what's after the hour, or 'past' 4.

16
0:1:51,000 --> 0:2:00,000
So if for example it's 5 minutes… 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 - it's '5 past 4'.

17
0:2:01,000 --> 0:2:10,000
Or maybe it's 10 minutes after, so… 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10… '10 past 4'.

18
0:2:12,000 --> 0:2:21,000
Here is 5, 10, 15, 20 minutes, so 20 past 4.

19
0:2:23,000 --> 0:2:32,000
And here another 5 minutes, 25 minutes so 25 past 4.

20
0:2:33,000 --> 0:2:43,000
So, when we come round to this side of the clock, we're thinking about the next hour we're coming to.

21
0:2:44,000 --> 0:2:53,000
So for example, quarter of an hour until 5.

22
0:2:53,000 --> 0:2:56,000
Quarter 'to' 5.

23
0:2:56,000 --> 0:3:02,000
Here, it's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 minutes until 5 o'clock

24
0:3:03,000 --> 0:3:06,000
So we say, '5 to 5'.

25
0:3:07,000 --> 0:3:14,000
Or '5 to 2'.

26
0:3:15,000 --> 0:3:20,000
Or maybe - '5 to 4'.

27
0:3:25,000 --> 0:3:38,000
Now we have 5, 10, 15, 20 minutes until 4, so we say, '20 to 4'.

28
0:3:39,000 --> 0:3:41,000
So we're going to practice now

29
0:3:43,000 --> 0:3:44,000
4 o'clock

30
0:3:45,000 --> 0:3:48,000
5 past 4.

31
0:3:51,000 --> 0:3:52,000
10 past 4.

32
0:3:56,000 --> 0:3:57,000
Quarter past 4.

33
0:4:02,000 --> 0:4:05,000
20 past 4.

34
0:4:08,000 --> 0:4:10,000
25 past 4.

35
0:4:11,000 --> 0:4:14,000
And half past 4.

36
0:4:17,000 --> 0:4:19,000
25 to 5.

37
0:4:21,000 --> 0:4:24,000
20 to 5.

38
0:4:27,000 --> 0:4:29,000
Quarter to 5.
