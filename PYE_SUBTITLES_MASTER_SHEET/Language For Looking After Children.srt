0:0:00,000 --> 0:0:07,000
Language for looking after children

2
0:0:07,000 --> 0:0:12,000
If you have children they can be a natural connection point for talking to other people.

3
0:0:12,000 --> 0:0:17,000
In the UK we have lots of parent and toddler groups for pre-school children.

4
0:0:17,000 --> 0:0:22,000
You might meet in the playground, or you might talk to other parents when you’re waiting

5
0:0:22,000 --> 0:0:25,000
to drop your kids off at school, or pick them up.

6
0:0:25,000 --> 0:0:30,000
So we’re going to look at some of the language to help you with those conversations.

7
0:0:30,000 --> 0:0:34,000
So let’s practise some of the language you might need

8
0:0:34,000 --> 0:0:38,000
when you’re with your children and other families.

9
0:0:38,000 --> 0:0:42,000
“Where are the toilets please? They’re over there’

10
0:0:42,000 --> 0:0:47,000
“Does he need a drink? Yes please.’

11
0:0:47,000 --> 0:0:52,000
‘We’re going to the park, do you want to come?

12
0:0:52,000 --> 0:0:55,000
Did he hurt himself? No, he’s OK thanks.

13
0:0:55,000 --> 0:0:59,000
“Where are the toilets please? They’re over there’

14
0:0:59,000 --> 0:1:04,000
Are the kids OK? They’re just a bit bored. Shall we tidy the toys now?

15
0:1:04,000 --> 0:1:07,000
Do they need a drink? Thanks, that’s great.

16
0:1:07,000 --> 0:1:10,000
Does he need something to eat? Thanks, what have you got?

17
0:1:10,000 --> 0:1:16,000
We’re going to the park on Sunday at 1 o’clock. Do you want to come?

18
0:1:16,000 --> 0:1:19,000
Where are the toilets please?

19
0:1:19,000 --> 0:1:38,000
They’re over there. So listen. That’s it, yes.

20
0:1:38,000 --> 0:1:46,000
Does he need a drink, or does she need a drink for a girl.

21
0:1:46,000 --> 0:1:59,000
Yes, that’s good. So this one – ‘We’re going to the park’.

22
0:1:59,000 --> 0:2:05,000
Do you want to come? So it’s ‘d’you want’.

23
0:2:05,000 --> 0:2:10,000
We don’t say ‘do you want’. D’you want to come? Very good.
