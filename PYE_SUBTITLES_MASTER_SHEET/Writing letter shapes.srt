Writing letter shapes

2
0:0:08,000 --> 0:0:10,000
Now we’re going to show you how to make the shapes of the letters. 

3
0:0:11,000 --> 0:0:14,000
You start with the black line, 

4
0:0:14,000 --> 0:0:19,000
and you keep your pencil or pen on the paper board until you've finished that letter.

5
0:04:16,000 --> 0:04:22,000
So getting the curved circle shapes of the letters right can take a bit of practice, 

6
0:04:23,000 --> 0:04:26,000
sometimes people squash them or get them in the wrong direction. 

7
0:04:27,000 --> 0:04:33,000
So we really want to go all the way round and make a good big circle for a lot of these letters. 

8
0:04:33,000 --> 0:04:37,000
It goes across, and then round like this

9
0:04:37,000 --> 0:04:45,000
So you can see that my letters are sitting on the line – we haven’t got them up floating, 

10
0:04:45,000 --> 0:04:48,000
we’ve got them down, touching.

11
0:04:48,000 --> 0:04:52,000
And when I write a word, the letters are close together. 

12
0:04:52,000 --> 0:04:57,000
We don’t want big gaps, like this.we want them close. 

13
0:04:57,000 --> 0:05:02,000
So these letters go up higher in the air than the other ones.

14
0:05:02,000 --> 0:05:06,000
so you need to make them nice and tall, OK?

15
0:05:07,000 --> 0:05:12,000
And these ones the letters go down under the line

16
0:05:12,000 --> 0:05:31,000
so you don’t want your ‘g’ to sit like this, it has to have a tail which hangs down.

17
0:05:31,000 --> 0:05:33,000
The other letters just sit on the line.

18
0:05:33,000 --> 0:05:47,000
So we want to leave a small space between each word. 

19
0:05:47,000 --> 0:05:52,000
And then when you get even better, you can make your letters smaller, 

20
0:05:52,000 --> 0:06:02,000
and put your words closer together. 

21
0:06:04,000 --> 0:06:11,000
It takes practice but you will see your writing getting neater and neater over time.
