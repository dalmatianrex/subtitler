1
0:0:00,000 --> 0:0:08,000
Saying hello

2
0:0:08,000 --> 0:0:15,000
We’re going to learn how to say, ‘Hi, how are you? Fine thanks, you?’

3
0:0:15,000 --> 0:0:18,000
There are different ways to greet people in English.

4
0:0:19,000 --> 0:0:21,000
Here are some that you might hear when you’re outside.

5
0:0:22,000 --> 0:0:26,000
Hi, how are you? Fine, thanks, you? Yes, fine.

6
0:0:27,000 --> 0:0:30,000
How you doing? Yes, good, you? I’m OK.

7
0:0:30,000 --> 0:0:32,000
Alright? Yeah, you?

8
0:0:34,000 --> 0:0:37,000
In English we speak fast, and when we do

9
0:0:38,000 --> 0:0:41,000
we join the words together and change the sounds we make.

10
0:0:42,000 --> 0:0:44,000
We’re going to teach you to speak this way,

11
0:0:45,000 --> 0:0:48,000
so that when you’re outside, you can understand what people are saying to you.

12
0:0:49,000 --> 0:0:52,000
So here’s the example, with ‘hi, how are you?’

13
0:0:53,000 --> 0:1:06,000
Hi, how are you? Fine, thanks, you? 

14
0:1:07,000 --> 0:1:13,000
We make some words stronger, and we call it 'word stress'

15
0:1:14,000 --> 0:1:18,000
When you see the red, that's where the words are strong.

16
0:1:18,000 --> 0:1:26,000
Hi, how are you? Fine thanks, you?
