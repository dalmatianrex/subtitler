Checking in - how are you doing?

2
0:0:09,000 --> 0:0:14,000
Many of your first conversations in English are people asking you how your're doing

3
0:0:14,000 --> 0:0:16,000
and about your preferences and choices.

4
0:0:17,000 --> 0:0:19,000
So this video is to help you with that language.

5
0:0:19,000 --> 0:0:25,000
You’ll get asked about what you want and if you’re OK quite often while you’re settling in.

6
0:0:26,000 --> 0:0:27,000
Do you want coffee? Do you want tea?

7
0:0:28,000 --> 0:0:32,000
Yes; no; maybe; I’m not sure

8
0:0:33,000 --> 0:0:38,000
Are you OK? Fine, thanks. Are you OK? No, I’m not well.

9
0:0:38,000 --> 0:0:39,000
Are you ready now? Sure.

10
0:0:39,000 --> 0:0:46,000
Let’s practise ‘do you want?’ and ‘are you OK?’ as we use those a lot.

11
0:0:46,000 --> 0:0:48,000
D'you want a pen?

12
0:0:53,000 --> 0:0:55,000
So it's not 'do you', it's d'you

13
0:0:55,000 --> 0:0:57,000
Is it 'do you' or 'd'you'? 'D'you'.

14
0:0:57,000 --> 0:1:00,000
Yes, so we take 'do you', and put them together, 'd'you'

15
0:1:09,000 --> 0:1:10,000
D'you want a pen? Yes thanks. Here you are...

16
0:1:11,000 --> 0:1:14,000
Are you OK?

17
0:1:14,000 --> 0:1:19,000
And it's the same, OK. That's great, that's very good, yes.

18
0:1:19,000 --> 0:1:23,000
Fine thanks

19
0:1:24,000 --> 0:1:41,000
Are you OK? Maybe, I'm not sure.
