1
0:0:00,000 --> 0:0:08,000
Vowel sounds

2
0:0:08,000 --> 0:0:13,000
because my students found it difficult to remember the difference between these sounds,

3
0:0:13,000 --> 0:0:18,000
I found a way to help them by using my hands and my body.

4
0:0:19,000 --> 0:0:24,000
A is for apple, and we make the open mouth as if we’re biting an apple.

5
0:0:25,000 --> 0:0:29,000
E is for elephant, and elephant’s a strong animal with a big long nose,

6
0:0:29,000 --> 0:0:34,000
so we make a strong sound.

7
0:0:34,000 --> 0:0:41,000
I is a very thin letter, and the sound is very small

8
0:0:41,000 --> 0:0:44,000
O is for orange, which is a round fruit,

9
0:0:46,000 --> 0:0:47,000
and we make a round mouth when we say ‘o’,

10
0:0:47,000 --> 0:0:52,000
so I trace the shape of the circle around my mouth.

11
0:0:53,000 --> 0:1:04,000
and the last one 'u' we need an open mouth, so again we make the shape of the letter when we say the sound 'u'

12
0:1:04,000 --> 0:1:16,000
So we have ‘a’, ‘e’, ‘I’, ‘o’ and ‘u’

13
0:1:17,000 --> 0:1:21,000
They are important because every English word has one of these letters in.

14
0:1:21,000 --> 0:1:25,000
It can be difficult to tell the difference between these sounds,

15
0:1:25,000 --> 0:1:29,000
Also, people speak differently in different parts of the country.

16
0:1:29,000 --> 0:1:32,000
So these sounds change depending on where you live.
