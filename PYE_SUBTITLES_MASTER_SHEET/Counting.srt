Counting

2
0:0:08,000 --> 0:0:11,000
We use numbers all the time, for money, for time,

3
0:0:11,000 --> 0:0:16,000
and to give personal information like your date of birth or your post-code.

4
0:0:17,000 --> 0:1:24,000
11-20 is the most difficult bit of counting, and once you get past 20 it gets much easier.

5
0:1:25,000 --> 0:1:30,000
It can be very tricky to tell the difference between 13 and 30.

6
0:1:30,000 --> 0:1:35,000
You can do it by putting the word stress in the right place.

7
0:1:35,000 --> 0:1:42,000
So for the ‘teens’, it’s at the end of the word, 13, 14.

8
0:1:42,000 --> 0:1:50,000
For the 30, 40, 50 it’s at the beginning of the word – 30, 40, 50. 

9
0:1:51,000 --> 0:1:57,000
13, 30. 14, 40.

10
0:1:57,000 --> 0:2:05,000
15, 50, 16, 60

11
0:2:05,000 --> 0:2:12,000
17, 70. 18, 80

12
0:2:12,000 --> 0:2:15,000
19, 90
