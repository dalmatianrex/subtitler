1
00:00:00,00 --> 00:00:07,00
What are you doing tomorrow? 

2
00:00:08,05 --> 00:00:12,23
One way of making friends with people is to ask them about their plans.

3
00:00:13,14 --> 00:00:17,00
You can ask: ‘What are you doing tomorrow?’ What are you doing next week?

4
00:00:17,00 --> 00:00:19,00
What are you doing on Monday?’

5
00:00:21,00 --> 00:00:24,01
So let’s practise, "What are you doing tomorrow?"

6
00:00:25,07 --> 00:00:48,21
What are you doing tomorrow?

7
00:00:49,24 --> 00:01:00,11
I’m going to clean my house.

8
00:01:00,11 --> 00:01:01,05
Can you repeat ‘clean’ again?

9
00:01:02,05 --> 00:01:11,11
I’m going to clean my house.

10
00:01:12,19 --> 00:01:35,11
We’re going to visit friends.
