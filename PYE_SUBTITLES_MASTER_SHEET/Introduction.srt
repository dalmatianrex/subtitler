Introduction

0:0:08,000 --> 0:0:19,000
Hello and welcome. I’m Jos, a teacher from the UK with years of experience helping people learn spoken English.

3
0:0:19,000 --> 0:0:34,000
We know that some of you are not able to speak English or communicate effectively with those around you. Don't worry, we have designed this free fully translated course for you, focusing on really useful everyday language.

4
0:0:34,000 --> 0:0:42,000
Jos’s videos show you how to talk with others informally, using language other people will find friendly and easy to understand.

5
0:0:42,000 --> 0:0:50,000
The videos also help with pronunciation so you can speak at the same speed as people in the UK.

6
0:0:50,000 --> 0:1:00,000
For complete beginners we start from the basics, which are writing and sounding out the English alphabet, numbers, and easy things to say.

7
0:1:00,000 --> 0:1:11,000
For non-beginners, skip the phonics picture section and use the videos and workbook to learn more conversational speech and expressions, and develop your fluency skills.

8
0:1:11,000 --> 0:1:29,000
Each lesson is accompanied by a video so you can watch a teacher, and hear and practice speaking the language in the book. This focus on speaking and listening will make it easier both for you to understand English speakers, and to speak in a way they will understand.

0:1:29,000 --> 0:1:36,000
If you have a printed copy of the workbook, then scanning the QR code on each page will direct you to the video.

0:1:36,000 --> 0:1:43,000
Good luck, study well, and enjoy!
