1
0:0:00,000 --> 0:0:09,000
Where is it?

2
0:0:09,000 --> 0:0:14,000
Let’s practise some of the language for talking about belongings or objects now.

3
0:0:15,000 --> 0:0:16,000
Where is it?

4
0:0:18,000 --> 0:0:19,000
It’s over here

5
0:0:20,000 --> 0:0:22,000
It’s over there.

6
0:0:24,000 --> 0:0:31,000
We’ve got – 1 pen, 2 or 3 pens

7
0:0:34,000 --> 0:0:35,000
Pick it up

8
0:0:36,000 --> 0:0:37,000
Put it down

9
0:0:43,000 --> 0:0:45,000
Put it away

10
0:0:46,000 --> 0:0:48,000
Get it out

11
0:0:51,000 --> 0:0:53,000
Put it on

12
0:0:54,000 --> 0:0:55,000
And … take it off

13
0:0:56,000 --> 0:1:01,000
Where is it? It’s over there. Where is it? It’s over here.

14
0:1:02,000 --> 0:1:16,000
1 bag – a bag. 2 bags – some bags. 1 pen – a pen. 3 pens – some pens

16
0:1:17,000 --> 0:1:34,000
Pick it up, put it down, put it away, get it out, put it on, take it off

17
0:1:36,000 --> 0:1:49,000
Where is it? It’s over here. It’s over there. 1 pen, 3 pens.

18
0:1:50,000 --> 0:2:24,000
Pick it up, put it down, put it away, get it out, put it on, take it off.
