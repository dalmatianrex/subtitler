0:0:00,000 --> 0:0:08,000
Meeting new people

2
0:0:08,000 --> 0:0:11,000
Here’s what you say when you meet someone for the first time.

3
0:0:11,000 --> 0:0:15,000
What’s your name? I’m Rose. What’s your name? I’m Amy.

4
0:0:15,000 --> 0:0:17,000
Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you too.

5
0:0:17,000 --> 0:0:22,000
So let’s practice saying that, focussing on the sounds rather than the meaning.

6
0:0:24,000 --> 0:0:30,000
So what's your name?

7
0:0:31,000 --> 0:0:32,000
I’m Jos

8
0:0:33,000 --> 0:0:34,000
I’m Narges

0:0:36,000 --> 0:0:49,000
Nice to meet you.
