1
0:0:08,000 --> 0:0:08,000
Who were you with?

2
0:0:08,000 --> 0:0:12,000
Talking about what you did, people might ask you who you were with.

3
0:0:13,000 --> 0:0:16,000
As a beginner you don’t need to be able to ask these questions,

4
0:0:16,000 --> 0:0:20,000
but it can be useful to be able to understand and use simple language

5
0:0:20,000 --> 0:0:23,000
about family and friends to explain.

6
0:0:23,000 --> 0:0:26,000
Who did you go with? With my friend and her children.

7
0:0:26,000 --> 0:0:29,000
Who did you go with? With my brother and sister.

0:0:29,000 --> 0:0:34,000
Son, Daughter. Brother, sister. Mum, Dad.

Grandad, Grandma. Aunt, Uncle, Cousin.

10
0:0:42,000 --> 0:0:44,000

12
0:0:46,000 --> 0:0:49,000

13
0:0:49,000 --> 0:0:50,000

0:0:52,000 --> 0:0:56,000
Who did you go with? Great - Really good!

With my friend and her children. Yes.

16
0:1:09,000 --> 0:1:12,000
So we’re making the sounds very short, yes.

17
0:1:12,000 --> 0:1:12,000
OK, how about this one?

18
0:1:13,000 --> 0:1:15,000
With my daughter.

19
0:1:16,000 --> 0:1:17,000
