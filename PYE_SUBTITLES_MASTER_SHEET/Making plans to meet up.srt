0:0:00,000 --> 0:0:08,000
Making plans to meet up

2
0:0:08,000 --> 0:0:14,000
This video teaches you language to ask people to meet and do something together.

3
0:0:15,000 --> 0:0:20,000
It’s really important for your wellbeing and mental health to spend time with your friends,

4
0:0:21,000 --> 0:0:23,000
and it’s also important for children to meet up with their friends outside school

5
0:0:23,000 --> 0:0:25,000
and have time to play together.

6
0:0:25,000 --> 0:0:28,000
Shall we meet at the weekend? Sure, how about on Sunday?

7
0:0:28,000 --> 0:0:33,000
Fine. What time? How about 11? OK.

8
0:0:33,000 --> 0:0:36,000
So, let’s practise the questions and answers.

9
0:0:36,000 --> 0:0:39,000
Shall we meet at the weekend?

10
0:0:40,000 --> 0:0:42,000
How about on Sunday?

11
0:0:42,000 --> 0:0:43,000
Where are you?

12
0:0:44,000 --> 0:1:04,000
Should we meet at the weekend?

13
0:1:04,000 --> 0:1:07,000
One more. It’s quite difficult isn’t it? We’ll try it one more time.

14
0:1:07,000 --> 0:1:10,000
Shall we meet at the weekend?

15
0:1:11,000 --> 0:1:19,000
And can you hear it, ‘shu' we meet? You don't say the 'll'. You just say, 'shu' we meet for the weekend? Excellent!

16
0:1:19,000 --> 0:1:24,000
So it's just, Sh'll we meet for the weekend?

17
0:1:24,000 --> 0:1:32,000
Ok, shall we do this one? How about on Sunday?

18
0:1:34,000 --> 0:1:36,000
In English we almost sing, you know we go up and down.

19
0:1:36,000 --> 0:1:38,000
So,‘How about on Sunday?

20
0:1:39,000 --> 0:1:43,000
Can you try? ‘How about on Sunday?’ Good, I like the eyebrows!

21
0:1:48,000 --> 0:1:55,000
Where are you? Difficult. So, ‘where are you?’
