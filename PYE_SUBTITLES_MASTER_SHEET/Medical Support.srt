Medical support

0:0:07,000 --> 0:0:14,000
This video is to help you understand some of the things you might hear at the hospital or at the doctors.

3
0:0:14,000 --> 0:0:23,000
First, we're going to practise a couple of things to say and then we're going to listen to some of the things you might hear.

4
0:0:23,000 --> 0:0:24,300
Hi

5
0:0:24,300 --> 0:0:26,000
Can you just wait to be called please?

6
0:0:26,300 --> 0:0:27,300
Can you come through, please?

7
0:0:27,300 --> 0:0:29,000
Just follow the blue line.

8
0:0:29,300 --> 0:0:30,300
Do you have any allergies?

9
0:0:30,300 --> 0:0:31,300
No.

10
0:0:31,300 --> 0:0:32,300
Do you get free prescriptions?

11
0:0:32,300 --> 0:0:33,300
Yes.

12
0:0:33,300 --> 0:0:35,300
Can I have an interpreter please?

13
0:0:35,300 --> 0:0:37,000
Yes. Would you like a chaperone?

14
0:0:37,000 --> 0:0:38,300
No thank-you.

15
0:0:39,000 --> 0:0:40,000
Is it done now?

16
0:0:40,000 --> 0:0:42,000
Let's practiceâ€¦

17
0:0:42,300 --> 0:0:45,300
interpreter please

18
0:0:45,300 --> 0:0:49,300
have an interpreter please

19
0:0:50,000 --> 0:0:54,300
Can I have an interpreter please?

20
0:0:54,300 --> 0:0:55,300
Very good.

21
0:0:56,300 --> 0:1:05,300
And this question for when you think it's OK, they're done and you can go, but you want to check.

22
0:1:06,000 --> 0:1:07,300
So, let's practice

23
0:1:08,300 --> 0:1:11,300
done now

24
0:1:11,300 --> 0:1:14,300
Is it done now?

25
0:1:14,300 --> 0:1:18,300
These are the things you might hear that you want to understand.

26
0:1:20,000 --> 0:1:21,300
Wait to be called.

27
0:1:23,000 --> 0:1:24,300
Can you come through please?

28
0:1:25,300 --> 0:1:27,300
Do you have any allergies?

29
0:1:27,300 --> 0:1:29,300
Do you get free prescriptions?

30
0:1:29,300 --> 0:1:32,300
Do you want a chaperone?

31
0:1:32,300 --> 0:1:40,300
And this last one is for hospitals which are very big, so they have colour systems to help you find your way.

32
0:1:40,300 --> 0:1:44,300
So, somebody might tell you, 'Follow the blue line',

33
0:1:44,300 --> 0:1:51,000
and then you look for the blue line , and you follow it to get to the right part of the hospital.
