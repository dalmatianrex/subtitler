1
0:0:00,000 --> 0:0:07,000
Directions

2
0:0:08,000 --> 0:0:14,000
Sometimes people feel a bit anxious about going outside in a new place in case they get lost.

3
0:0:14,000 --> 0:0:22,000
This language is to help you ask for directions and understand when people tell you where to go.

4
0:0:23,000 --> 0:0:26,000
The first two are things for you to say,

5
0:0:27,000 --> 0:0:31,300
and this is for you to understand and listen when other people speak.

6
0:0:31,300 --> 0:0:32,300
Straight ahead

7
0:0:32,300 --> 0:0:33,300
Turn left

8
0:0:33,300 --> 0:0:34,300
Turn right

9
0:0:34,300 --> 0:0:36,300
Over there

10
0:0:36,300 --> 0:0:37,300
A bit further down

11
0:0:37,300 --> 0:0:39,000
Just around the corner

12
0:0:40,000 --> 0:0:42,000
So, let's practise:

13
0:0:43,300 --> 0:0:49,300
Excuse me, where's the supermarket

14
0:0:49,300 --> 0:0:51,300
supermarket

15
0:0:51,300 --> 0:0:54,290
the supermarket

16
0:0:54,300 --> 0:0:57,300
where's the supermarket?

17
0:0:57,300 --> 0:1:04,300
Excuse me, where's the supermarket

18
0:1:05,300 --> 0:1:10,300
I'm a bit lost

19
0:1:10,300 --> 0:1:12,300
lost

20
0:1:12,300 --> 0:1:14,300
bit lost

21
0:1:14,300 --> 0:1:16,030
a bit lost

22
0:1:16,300 --> 0:1:22,000
I'm a bit lost.

23
0:1:23,000 --> 0:1:25,300
Now let's practice listening

24
0:1:27,300 --> 0:1:28,300
You're nearly there.

25
0:1:29,300 --> 0:1:31,300
It’s just over the road.

26
0:1:31,300 --> 0:1:34,300
Keep going until the lights.

27
0:1:35,000 --> 0:1:36,300
Straight ahead

28
0:1:37,000 --> 0:1:38,300
Turn left

29
0:1:38,300 --> 0:1:39,300
Turn right

30
0:1:40,000 --> 0:1:41,000
Over there

31
0:1:43,300 --> 0:1:44,300
A bit further down

32
0:1:45,300 --> 0:1:46,300
Just around the corner

33
0:1:47,300 --> 0:1:48,300
Thank you!

34
0:1:48,300 --> 0:1:49,300
You’re welcome.
